Stylus Utility Belt
=========
### Shorthand Media Queries, Inline Class Triggers, & Breakpoint Inspector for Stylus.
Built with love by [JOEY](http://joeylabs.com) while working at [Carrot](http://carrot.is). 

#### What's inside?
1. This project includes a subtle CSS-powered widget to show you which breakpoint you're currently in for easier development (`css/_breakpoint_inspector`)
2. Stylus shorthand for `@media` breakpoints for various resolutions and retina pixel density for easier responsive development (`css/_mediaqueries`)
3. A plethora of inline CSS tags to trigger visibility on various resolutions (`css/_visibility_helpers`)

#### Credits
- These media queries were modeled after the default breakpoints found in Twitter Bootstrap 3. They can be customized to your liking in `css/_mediaqueries`. When you compile your stylesheet the changes are made globally.
- I created this after seeing something similar coded in a project at [Carrot](http://carrot.is). I decided to modularize a version of my own.

#### Setup / Installation
- Install [Stylus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/stylus)
- Clone this repo down and `cd` into it
- Copy the partials from `/css` into your Stylus CSS directory.
- View `example.styl` for examples on how to import the partials to your Stylus CSS and as a reference on how to use
- Compile with your Stylus-powered project.
- Profit!
